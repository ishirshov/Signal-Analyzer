## Description
The Signal Analyzer it's a digital oscilloscope with advanced features which can handle the signal with big sampling   
frequency (over 250 MHz which equal 476 MBytes/sec) in real-time mode. Algorithms of signal processing based on   
Intel® Integrated Performance Primitives, Intel® Math Kernel Library and Intel® Thread Building Blocks libraries.   
UI of this project based on Qt, Qwt libraries and ported on Qt 4.6.3, 4.8.3 and 5.2.1 versions.

## Main features
1. Signal processing with different sampling rates (from 1 Hz to 450 Mhz) in 16-bit mode;
2. Extraction signal's amplitude-frequency characteristics;
3. Signal processing using linear and nonlinear filters;
4. Working with multichannel devices;
5. Support for multithreaded processing signal;
6. Identification signal's frequencies and more.
